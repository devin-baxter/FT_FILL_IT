# FT_FILL_IT
Working/Final repository for FILL_IT in the 42 cursus

This is a functional program that is a rough approximation of the game "Tetris" in which files containing "tetriminos" is passed to a validation function and then to a sorting function which uses recursive backtracking. This is the second project in the 42 Silicon Valley cursus.

TO RUN PROGRAM:
Git clone the repository to your computer. Enter the cloned-repository and type "make re" in order to create the "fillit" executable. Then simply type "./fillit test1" or either of the other two test files to run and see output in terminal. Feel free to try and improve the speed or number of tetriminos it can handle!
