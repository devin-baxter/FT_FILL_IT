# FT_FILL_IT
Working/Final repository for FILL_IT in the 42 cursus

This is a functional program that is a rough approximation of the game "Tetris" in which files containing "tetriminos" is passed to a validation function and then to a sorting function which uses recursive backtracking. This is the second project in the 42 Silicon Valley cursus.
